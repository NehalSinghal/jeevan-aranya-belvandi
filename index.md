Bamboo net. 

Bamboo dome for polyhouse effect without using polythene.

Work with available material.

Joshanda seeds. For health and sowing.

Sahjan (Moringa) cultivated. Multi cropping most important. More than 16000 saplings planted in belvandi farm in 50 Acre. Sweet variety plant of Sahjan at Sudha Mishra aunty house, Dehradun. Right variety plantation of Sahjan crucial.

Amla can be in farm for multi-cropping too. Doesn't harm crop growing under it. Amla can be planted at boundary. 

Dragon fruit to be planted. Not done yet. **TODO**

Less people for supervision. There are MANAGEMENT ISSUES. **TODO**

Multi cropping in 30-40 acres. Ginger and Sahjan (Moringa) planted together.

Survival rate is 100% for Moringa. Dense forest of Moringa will grow.
16000 plants are too much.

Deepak ji is level headed person. Hard-working. Heart to heart relation with Deepak ji. People cannot be bound by mind. It's heart only that brings people together.

Moringa powder. Leaves to be powdered. 

Flowers. Drumsticks. Maintenance free tree.

Little trimming required. But even if that is not there still it's a sturdy plant.

First year survival is crucial. End of season rain, this year 2021, is very good.

Papaya also grown. Papaya and Moringa alternate planting. Deepak ji is real master in horticulture.

Banana must be planted. Labor issue in Belvandi.

Supervision also needed.

Vinish Gupta ji, Goa: Shramdaan based volunteering. Children groups can visit Belvandi farm. Satsang. Online/offline. Labor needed only for weeding. Otherwise all done by volunteers.

Jackfruit: Right varieties saplings to be found. Jackfruit expert with us. Jackfruit saplings will be organised. 

Supply chain is important and crucial for commercial viability.

Oxygen, Nature, birds, 150 families, 16000 plants, 20 plants per person done. 

Marketing and revenue generation are to be worked out. Strategy building. **TODO**

Lemon grass. Citronella. Mosquitoes are a big problem. Citronella in pots will sell like hot cake. Lemon grass is very popular in Maharashtra. Gautichaha (lemon grass tea). Sturdy crop. Citronella is also sturdy crop.

Herbal Garden should come up.

Amazon is also only in supply chain management, yet more influence than producers.

Online initiative for Belvandi. Prateek effort. Core Team Management weak. It takes atleast two years to establish a business.

Belvandi to Pune goods transportation, mini truck rate. Distribution.

Value unlocking.
Make people farmers. Terrace farming. All kinds of plants.

Office going people have vacant terrace. Facilitate urban farming for urban people. Khetify from IIT KGP guys in Gurgaon. Highly monetized. We should make open source, sharing, caring and justified, people centric community based inclusive sustainable model.

Make Belvandi base. Handle Pune and other regions from Belvandi.

Black pepper also sowed. 3-4 places black pepper planted.

Black pepper development in dome. Unni Nair house in Conoor, Kerala. Dense forest in his house.

Neem was not growing. Mahaneem as an alternative to Neem grows in Dehradun. Looks somewhat like Neem. Color lighter than Neem. Used for medicine and plywood. Belvandi also has Mahaneem. Turmeric. Black pepper planted at Mahaneem base.

Snakes not seen so far at Belvandi farm.

Bamboo and bananas to be planted. **TODO**

What is the aim? Clarity in aim is required. Talk with core team required. Vision for ten years. Each member to write own vision and mission on paper. Right now it's crisis management.

Amla Rs 8/- per Kg in a friend's farm. It was through contractor. That was how it had to be sold.

Decision making process and community structure is most important.
Who's farm? Whether a federation or common decision regulated on all?
